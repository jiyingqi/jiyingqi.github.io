              Hi dumpy truck, this is my 22nd birthday gift for you<br>
              I made a bunch of audio clips for you to listen to everyday<br>
              until we get back together.<br>
              I hope you enjoy and that you have a really amazing day!!<br>
              Isn't it so funny that we gave each other almost the exact same gift<br>
              for our birthdays??? How similar must we be hahaha<br>
              I didn't write you a really cute letter but hopefully this website makes up for it<br>
              I love you so much and i'm sure you already know about everything I love about you but<br>
              if you don't I will always tell you<br>
              - froglegs<br>

              Script: Hi Audrey, its yo birthday. im probably going to talk to you so much today and you will have so much fun hopefully! anddd i have work off tomorrorow when its actually your birthday in the states of america whichhhhh you probably dont remember that much about anymore. ill clue you in, its kinda hot over here not gonna lie too hot in fact... well youre probably wondering why im doing this, why im sending you a website with a bunch of recordings or one recording depending on how good of a software engineer i am but you will understand. i hope (laugh) dot dot dot. this is your birthday gift and hmm i wanted to buy you so many things and treat you so well but you are so far what can I do you know. I wanted to make you this because i know you like my voice and i wanted to give you something to listen to when you are ever feeling lonely and bored and if you miss me a little which i hope is all the time but if not whatever we'll see. my main motivation for doing this is well you and i like to see you happy and my side motivation not like my side ho just kidding im not joking about that anymore my side motivation was after watching a tv show i wont disclose the name so maybe you will go on a journey to discover what that tv show is in that tv show the guy had to leave a years worth of messages for the girl because he was going to a place without cell signal so i thought you know youre in korea and im in seattle what if i got lost and stranded in the mountain and you weren't able to talk to me for a loong time basically until you got back from korea and visited seattle to try to find me. well lets just say you found me but i had all these recordings saved for you. so yeah thats my side motivation and i wanted to try this out to see how interesting the voice in my head is and if i can really just converse with myself and idk maybe ill just fall in love with myself and become super narcassistic and idk make something cool you know. okay i feel like i went on a crazy long tangent and ill just bring it back. its your 22nd birthday im so happy youre finally my age again and so i wont treat you like a baby anymore actually nevermind ill still treat you like one if you want. here ill just sing the happy birthday song to you in this recording so you can listen to it over and over again if you really wanted to no biggie if all my work is just seen one time because i can always do new things and im exciting and interesting.. anyways i guess here goes. happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear audrey park its your 22nd birthday and i hope we can celebrate more in the future happy birthday to you. well i hope you enjoyed it and im going to end the recording. look forward to the future ones cuz i recorded kinda a lot and yeah i hope you enjoy.
