              Hi dumpy truck, this is my 22nd birthday gift for you<br>
              I made a bunch of audio clips for you to listen to everyday until we get back together.<br>
              I hope you enjoy and that you have a really amazing day for an amazing person!!<br>
              Isn't it so funny that we gave each other almost the exact same gift<br>
              for our birthdays??? How similar are we?!?!?!? hahaha<br>
              I didn't write you a really cute letter but hopefully this website makes up for it<br>
              I love you so much and i'm sure you already know about everything that I love about you but<br>
              if you don't then I will always tell you<br>
              - froglegs<br><br>
              PS: the background image has some secrets you can see if you use different window sizes<br>
              PPS: these recordings are meant to be listened to one per day but if you want to binge go for it :)

                HI AUDREY, its your birthday. I'm going to talk to you so much today but I really hope you go out and celebrate and that you have so much fun today because you are the funnest person in the whole entire world to be around. I love you so much and I just want you to feel as happy as I did when you celebrated my birthday. I made a behind the scenes audio clip as well for these messages which you can listen to but they are kinda boring because i'm mainly drafting these messages they might include some special dialogue or give you an insight into what i'm actually like when i plan these things for you. you will find out that the behind the scenes for this message is a lot different from what I actually say. I made this first audio clip message a while ago and my feelings are so much stronger right now so I decided to remake it but I didn't want to redo the behind the scenes because then you can also sorta experience the message from before there, a 2 in 1 deal sorta thing you know. I just want you to know that you are my most closest, favoritest, and beautifulest best friend and girlfriend in this whole entire galaxy. When we started dating it really felt like all the stars aligned and I just want to appreciate you for being such an important figure in my life. Words can't describe how much I love you but I hope you can appreciate the time and effort I put into this gift and maybe that will give you an insight into my love for you. I wanted to make you this because i know you like my voice and i wanted to give you something to listen to when you are ever feeling lonely and bored and if you miss me a little which i hope is all the time but if not whatever we'll see. my main motivation for doing this is well you and i like to see you happy and my side motivation not like my side ho just kidding im not joking about that anymore my side motivation was after watching a tv show i wont disclose the name so maybe you will go on a journey to discover what that tv show is in that tv show the guy had to leave a years worth of messages for the girl because he was going to a place without cell signal so i thought you know youre in korea and im in seattle what if i got lost and stranded in the mountain and you weren't able to talk to me for a loong time basically until you got back from korea and visited seattle to try to find me. well lets just say you found me but i had all these recordings saved for you. so yeah thats my side motivation and i wanted to try this out to see how interesting the voice in my head is and if i can really just converse with myself. I want to sing you the happy birthday song for you, here goes! happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear audrey park its your 22nd birthday and i hope we can celebrate more in the future happy birthday to my love, my baby, my dumpy truck. I want every birthday of yours to be super special to you and when you come back to me, I want to buy you a gift that you will always remember. Toodle doo and I hope you enjoy all these messages.

                whatsup my gucci gang gucci mang audrey park woman of the century cover of time magazine, what else you know cover on vogue cuz your legs aint too long. i hope you got that reference but if you didn't then u can look it up on tiktok or something i think that is where i heard it first. well its july 4th and ur still in korea they probably dont celebrate july 4th right so you wont be able to see any fireworks or anyything like that, which is kinda sad but i can help simulate what it will look you know so you can imagine in your head what im seeing over here well first it would be pitch black and im sitting on a blanket by myself surrounded by numerous couples and just kinda feeling lonely but whatever jokes on them they dont have our relationship and then boom explosion sounds (for like a minute or something something embarrasing you know haha) well you get my drift its loud and annoying and bright and theres just so much smoke everywher and it smells stinky like smoky and couple are kissing the kids are screaming i dont think i would enjoy it that much, you know what i would like to do. is if we dressed up in yukatas and i wear a kimono i think idk japanese culture that well and we go to fireworks and then to the shrine and i get horrible luck but you get amazing luck so it balances out to just luck and we look at some other charms and it says you know great compatibiltyu amazing romance deep heartbreak gasp jk no deep heartbreak and that would be a really ufn date but for now you know im sitting here misrable and just waiting for you to come back home so i can see oyu and hug you and do other things yeah haha (cute).  anyways i hope today is another good day full of happiness and yummy food and love. cheers to the flag, not going to sing in this recording but youll hear some really gnarly stuff in the behind the scenes oh gosh. well happy 4th of july and happy day to you in korea.

                well this is gonna be a real boring audio clip audrey dont know what to say, you might as well just blame july 5th for being such a (pause) not boring day but not fun day either its just so so i mean lets just discuss semantics i mean what else would we be discussing. so july 5th just look at it write it 7/5 this is a day where nothing will happen and you will just live some kinda life its a day which everyone forgets and everyone even forgets the people who are born that day. well i know u will probably argue but do you know 1 person who is born on july 5th? without googling riddle me that batman? cuz im the riddler and i think he just gets clapped by batman well you know the criminals in gotham city are pretty bad. actually lets talk about gotham idk if you watched the movies or seen any batman content, since we dont share any common interests i dont think we will, but you know if ur ever down i love the batman trilogy with christian bale and i would love to just watch with you. we will probably get distracted during the trilogy since they are really freaking long no kapp umm you will probably get bored and want to do something else kinda similar to that one batman villain poison ivy, if you see her youll catch my drift. anyways i love batman hes such a smart person and strong and sexy as hell and looks in black and christian bale is just hot not hot like you though, but handsome hot. well you, my lady, are like a raging inferno created by bombs that the joker set off and created two face. thats how hot you are. idk what im saying in this recording ill just end it here. i love you like how man loves bats which caused this whole coronavirus thing in the first place but im not gonna get too political but batman yeah woohoo!

                hi baby, surprise surprise you couldnt avoid the lovey dovey and going to be kinda sappy message on this day. i really really miss you right now as im recording and also when you hear this i will be missing you even more. i just really really like talkiung to you and i know you really really like talking to me hopefully. omg im just wondering if you feel lik eits stockhom syndrome or something like im the beast and youre the beauty. and we got talking cups and plates and pitchers just hovering everywhere you know convincing that your in love with me omg what if the beast drugged the beauty so that shes hallucinating and hes manipulating her brain to fall in love with him. oh my god disney you are a bunch of sick bastards. how can you call this a childrens show, that is just sickening to me. anyways yeah i hope its not stockhom syndrome where i was like imprisoning you as my best friend for so long and i think maybe i kept boy from getting close to you because of your association to me haha well it worked so i have no qualms about it. gosh i spent so long of this supposedly sappy lovely message talking about something that is not very sappy or lovely. well thats fine because i have many more chances in the future to give oyu these messages and who knows maybe there will be a really spicyy only time will tell and audrey parents or even my parents if you are listening to this behind the scenese lets just say you didnt hear or see any of these weird messages yeah that will be goof for both you and me. well gosh i think i used all my time even though I dont have limits or anything but i kinda want to limit my messages so that i dont spend my entire life on one although that will be a legend of its own i guess but id rather not spend my entire working on one thing and rather multiple for audreys behalf. ok should i sing a song,,, Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey) You don't have to be a star Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey) I love you just the way you are For love is just the same Without fortune or fame Just give me True love and understanding True love and understanding i miss you a lot and i really hope i can see you soon.

                did you know today is 7/7 audrey park do you know what that means. well i can tell you but then id have to kill you just kidding its not some super secret day or anything but its a double prime day with a palindrome and yeah pretty cool huh. speaking of prime day it just ended today when i recorded this. did you order anything off of amazon? probably not because you are in korea. well even if you could order im sure you wouldnt like a amazon fire tablet or amazon echo or amazon this amazon that because tbh amazon products are kinda boring none of it gets me excited. i dont think i bought any amazon product off amazon ever actually they have some good things, i remember ordering the amazon basics laptop sleeve and it was so soft and fun to touch but then the latch broke and so what the heck poor quality. anyways if you didnt order anything off of amazon for prime day thats okay jeff bezos will cut my pay actually no not jeff cuz hes no longer the ceo of amazon its andy jassy who was the head of aws so ... not like anything changed ya know. well yeah i understand you not subsidizng my pay but you will have to make it up some other way winky face smiley face blushing open eye laughing and crying emoji. i love the open eye laughing and crying emoji btw i remember my first time seeing it was when a senior engineer sent it to me after he was working on a pretty complicated problem for a while and i saw it and it was soo funny i always see that face when i see osmething which is funny but also kinda sad but you cant be sad so you have to laugh and cry and your eyes are open when you really want to just be sad but you have to laugh because ther are people looking at you and you cannot do anyhting else yeah i dont think i have ever felt that way though. even if that did happen to me im sure i just repressed the memory rhyme bars cappacino. ok i think thats enough if you want something funny to listen to you can listen to the amazon alexa with an indian voice singing a song to you just ask her or him to sing a song and its so funny with the accent. good bye!!! see you tomorrow :)

                Welcome to the jeapordy game show where the contestant is you and all the questions are dealing with me. okay lets go so im not sure if you understand what jeapordy is but basically you will choose a category but you cant choose category or price if we are playing this game so heres what ill do ill choose for you and basically if u can answer them thats good you, you will gain points but if you cant or answer wrongly then you lose points and so by the end of the game if you have negative points then ill have to see you after the gameshow for some punishement. and no, no purposefully getting negative points just so you can be punished its not going to be fun, im warning you. okay so the category name is get your facts straight. and we are going to start with $100, $200, $300, $400, $500 so basically try your best to answer these correct and whoe knows maybe theres a double jeopardy. ok lets get this game show rolling. so audrey which category and price will you start off with today. hi my name is audrey and i would like to pick get your facts straight for $200 alright sounds good with me. ddddouble trouble wow i've never seen a double trouble on the first question of the show, now my friend as you know in double trouble the point value gained or taken away is doubled. thats why its called double trouble. heres the question, for $400 dollars what classes did jiying share with his most favorite person in teh world in high scool. bzzz yes do you have your answer audrey, (pause). ok the answer was sophomore year gym (its okay if you just say gym) ab calculus (again its okay if you say maths but only maths not math class because in europe they call it maths class and this is european jeapordy) and marine bio/oceanography if you say both fine if you say one fine again just need ms lisa wu to be here somehow. well i dont know if you got the answer right or not so ill leave it to you to grade for yourself but no cheating cuz ill be sad. ok now audrey back to you which suqare do you choose. I would like get your facts straight for $300., wow you are really bringing up this heat, alright for $300 dollars the question is what is the action you did after hanging out with a certain boy for all of techstravaganza which caught hiim by surprise? well the answer is hug, you scared the crap out of this ole man by doing that. next question, what will you have. I want get your facts straight for $500, alright for $500 what phrase did i use out of nowhere on your 22nd birthday? (pause) do you have your answer well the answer is honey bunched and oats. wow if you got this one right it should just be smooth sailing. ok did i hear you say you want get your facts straight for $400, no you didnt say that well ill just give it to you right now cuz im the host and you are the post. what did jiying consume for the first timewhen you guys went on a date to shilla bakery at tysons during a college break. (pause) well the answer is bingsoo wow theres kinda lots of fodd questions here maybe cuz im hungry. so that leaves the last but not least what does jiying like the most. if you cant answer this instantly im just subtracting a thousand points, but if you were thinking of yourself audrey or if you are not audrey audrey then you get 100 extra points. now lets do the tally up, see what your score is I got a pretty modest score of $1500 kinda crazy how is this possible ya kknow but i gues im really good at this category anyways. well let me know what you get and you shall either get rewarded or get the biggest punishment.

                Hello Audrey, its been a week since you recieved these messages and hopefully you havent gotten too sick of me or my voice and you still think im cute. i know for sure that i havent smiley. well gosh I was just thinking about on my walks / exercising i always pass by this bridge above aurora which is like a big street road a big stroad i think thats an actual term its like those big roads with more than two lanes but cars can still turn right or left into shops and the speed limit on those roads are always crazy fast like 50 mph or something wild i heard those kinds of roads are really dangerous and yeah thats what aurora is but i was thinking about how on aurora there is a bridge you have to cross if you want to get to the other side and on that bridge theres one lock and i remember when you sent me that picture of the lock you put in korea and omg i love that picture so much i mean i even made it into my computer wallpaper and its a lot better than what i had before. before during covid when i was traveling with my parents to rnadom places in an rv we went to florida and there we stopped at a bridge and i took a picture of a seagull through binoculars, i know right kinda boring and stuff but the picture had a bit of ghosting so it looked like the seagull was a ghost and the seagull was very white so yeah that was my picture before and but this one I love more. also my android phone cant take such good pictures i feel so bad i want to take really nice high quality pictures and send them to you so you will like to look at them... i mean you probably already like to look at the pictures i send but i still want to send very very high quality ones to you anyways. so i think i already know the answer to this question which is that im going to have to get a iphone and get sucked into the apple ecosystem. if theres anything i miss about android it will probably be nothing really, before i didnt want to switch because i read a lot of manga on this really cool app tachiyomi and i really liked it reading cool stories like hunter x hunter or idk my favorite was probably tokyo ghoul it was so cool. but i dont read them anymore ever since i got to seattle really cuz i just feel lik ei read the best ones so gotta move on  ya know and besides that i didnt use my android phone for that much i really do like the appl ewatches though they look sexy as flippity flop and they measure your health which i think is cool but yeah tim cook will probably get all my data but its fine. so my endgame gear will probably look like a windows desktop, apple macbook personal, apple phone, apple watch, and then maybe later they have something like apple cider that tastes really good and its a piece of technology that just produces it infinitely. that would be awesome... okay i think there was enough for you to think about from this so maybe ill let you make your decision. i would like to hear your endgame technology loadout i think you would definitely have something interesting in your hands. Goodbye.

                Hello audrey, its been a month and one day since we started dating and i just wanna say its so nice our anniversary date is in the middle of the year and th emiddle of every month, it makes it so easy to remember compared to like febuary 29, I feel like i always I forget about that date every 4 years so you know perfect timing. I just wanted to look back at random words mentioned in our conversations and you know see what we talked about. Ok word number one casualty, my message was LMAO watching our dance is gonna make everybody laugh when they see all thne guys doing like 20 body rolls in one minute there r gonna be casualties in the audience. woah, facebook actually can search up different suffixes of the same words thats very cool, would like to give a pat on the back to the engineer who coded that. this message was sent during junior year mex and i was complaining about how the dance we were gonna do was really dumb and oh my god u said you were going to slap me what's up with that. i do not deserve to get slapped... its actually kinda funny looking back at our old conversations i think i might do this more just on my own when i dont want to do anything else haha. ok word number 2, circumstance we talked about circumstance in the past after we started dating but before we started dating we actually used the word circumstance once. the conversation was so funny im gonna screenshot it, its so long, so you can read it again hahaha. omg but we were talking about how arthur likes to spill tea a lot and how we would feed him a fake rumor to see how far the tea travels and the scenario i come up with is so dumb omg. these kinds of conversations were so fun im so excited to have more of them with you. ok last word continental, we havent talked about continental before !??! omg ok ill start the conversation here then. i love continental breakfasts at 6 am in the morning at a motel while we are in the middle of driving to florida or something for vacation. idk I think it just hits different when youre really tired and you just start making some waffles and you get some of them sausages and bacon and a bowl of cereal and just everyone around you is feeling the exact same like just that dead energy inside its so enjoyable. i think it would be fun to wake up with you at 6 am and eat at a motel continental breakfast bar idk only if you want to im not forcing you to do anything. well i hope you liked looking back a little bit to what we talked before and yeah it was actually so fun I used this site to generate a random word and most of the times I could find it within our conversation. https://randomwordgenerator.com/

                Hi Audrey, I want to tell you about an ancient chinese folklore called xi xiang ji the romance of the west chamber. It tells the story of a secret love affair between Zhang Sheng, a young scholar, and Cui Yingying, the daughter of a chief minister of the Tang court. The two first meet in a Buddhist monastery. Yingying and her mother have stopped there to rest while escorting the coffin of Yingying's father to their native town. Zhang Sheng falls in love with her immediately, but is prevented from expressing his feelings while Yingying is under her mother's watchful eye. The most he can do is express his love in a poem read aloud behind the wall of the courtyard in which Yingying is lodging. However, word of Yingying's beauty soon reaches Sun the Flying Tiger, a local bandit. He dispatches ruffians to surround the monastery, in the hopes of taking her as his consort. Yingying's mother agrees that whoever drives the bandits away can have Yingying's hand in marriage, so Zhang Sheng contacts his childhood friend General Du, who is stationed not far away. The general subdues the bandits, and it seems that Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying are set to be married. However, Yingying's mother begins to regret her rash promise to Zhang Sheng, and takes back her word, with the excuse that Yingying is already betrothed to the son of another high official of the court. The two young lovers are greatly disappointed, and begin to pine away with their unfulfilled love. Fortunately, Yingying's maid, Hong Niang, takes pity on them, and ingeniously arranges to bring them together in a secret union. When Yingying's mother discovers what her daughter has done, she reluctantly consents to a formal marriage on one condition: Zhang must travel to the capital and pass the civil service examination. To the joy of the young lovers, Zhang Sheng proves to be a brilliant scholar, and is appointed to high office. The story thus ends on a happy note, as the two are finally married. I really like this story because the girls name has my nickname yingying but also this story is really important back then in China because in chinese culture it is very strict that you have to listen to your family and follow their every wishes. So a romantic story like this becoming popular was sort of a breakthrough in that young adults could fall in love with each other without any control from their parents. I hope you enjoyed the storytime and learned a little something of chinese culture.

                Hello my little Juliet, I want to read you the poems I made in Pollet for you. and even though I already shared them with you I think it would be nice if you could listen to them in my voice. Ok here goes, i'll be reading the two poems which I like the most wich are thes one that you really like as well. My first poem is titled: No Regrets: It was in June you passed me by It was in July you caught my eye Soon we were meeting both day and night The days suddenly seemed filled with light No, there are no regrets since you walked my way No, there are no regrets since we met that day Happiness and joy you seemed to bring A picnic under the sun went by in a dream When you departed you left a hole too big to fill Even after these many years I miss you still No, there are no regrets since you walked my way No, there are no regrets since we met that day. I really like this poem because its very bittersweet and I think the thats the best emotion for romantic poems, they sting a little but feel so good in your heart as you remember the old days. Heres my second poem Freeze this moment: We were sitting on your rooftop Staring at the skies The sun was dipping lower As I looked into your eyes You saw what I was feeling I know you felt it too We wanted time to just stand still Then forever there'd be me and you Why can't we freeze this moment? Return to it in time Stay together through the years Proclaim I'm yours and you are mine So let us freeze this moment Store it safely away Even if we leave this place We'll return to it someday. Again a bittersweet poem but reading this always brings me close to tears as honestly back then when I was writing these poems I was just thinking about you and you know im a romantic and even though we were really young I would want to experience these feelings with you. I was so crazy about you for so long and when I was so young could you believe I wrote these poems 6 years ago oh my god. I really want to write some more poems for you so be on the lookout and hopefully you will love me even more. byee!!

                Hello my dumpy truck, I want to talk about songs and how much they impact my life. As you know I also recorded a couple songs for you for your birthday gift and I really want you to enjoy them. But in the past I really loved talking about songs with you, you exposed me to so many different artists aka Marina and idk I cant think of them off the top of my mind but we talked about it quite a lot. By now I hope our playlists are kinda full but not too full and i hope we are still adding songs althgouh i've been finding out that im barely listening to song sanymore because im spending all my time with you which I think is better than listening to songs. Ever since I was a small kid I always felt like I was very musically inclined, I played violin for a really long time and I just sometimes get hugh spurts of artistic creativity. but a lot of the times I just give up on them because they last very short and if dont take action then nothing will be done. I hope you are able to make sure that I follow these creative spurts and finish them. Gosh I have so many unfinished projects that I want to do. I can tell you about one of them which is I want to create a two-pieced solid wooden shape that we will both have one and we can combine them when we are together. I want to make it out of really dense wood and make it so smooth its relaxing to just hold in your hands. I don't think I will be able to get to such a project but maybe when we are apart and you are in law school I will have a lot of time to do that. I have so many ideas I want to make that oh I should just create a doc okay i'll do that and i'll see how many of them I can fully finish. Anyways I spent this time to record two songs and I think you will already have listened to them by the time you get to this. I want to sing some songs with you later and record more songs in general I think it will be so fun and I know how beautiful your voice is from the songs you recorded for me for my birthday. I love you and I love all that you make me feel. I hope you have a really good day and I will talk to you forever <3.
              </p>

                Hi Audrey, tomorrow you will be coming back to me and back to home and I'll be so excited, it will be the first time I met you since last winter so what is that more than half a year how crazy is that. I want to let you know what we can in Seattle when you come over. First when you come back i'm going to take thursday and friday off so that I can just be with you. the time difference is going to suck for you so you will probably want to sleep and rest during the day and thats okay because i just want to sleep and rest with you and not do any work and so yeah. Ok on thursday when you arrive we will go to the Altura restaurant which will be so fun I hope. I'm so excited to just go on a fancy date with you just us two. I think you will look gorgeous and I will look spanking as well. And then after the restuarant, we can walk around the street in the city for a little bit and go to a couple stores and just briefly look around what seattle looks like. And then we will go home and have fun and i guess I dont need to say much about that ;). On friday, i want to go shopping with you because I still need to buy you a gift. i want to buy something really cute for you like some jewerely or anything you want because i wasn't able to get you one on your actual birthday it will be our first meeting gift. Friday I want to also do a lot of clothes shopping so I can update my warddrobe and you can help me with that because I only want to dress for you and it will be really fun. I'm gonna save so much money so we can spend it all on that day. I'll be like your sugar daddy it will be so fun. and on friday we can try out some fun stuff like you know what we talked about before at night and I think it will be really with you. For eating we will eat as we shop and stuff. On Saturday, I want to bring you to mt rainier or maybe some park or beach nearby and we can watch the sunset and stuff it will be really romantic and I think you will really like how much water/mountain/air/greenery there is in seattle its so natural and modern which is really the unique part of seattle. Then on sunday we will go back home together in the same flight and that will be so fun we will talk about so much and sleep on each other i will love it. And I can't even imagine spending my tiem with you, your family, my family all together it will be so fun. I hope your parents and my parents get along as well. Im so excited and I hope you are too, enjoy your day my little girl and I will see you so soon.
              </p>
