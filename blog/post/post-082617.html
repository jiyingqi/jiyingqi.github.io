              There's this one museum which really screwed us over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course it's not the museums fault or anything but, I still blame it for all our problems in Rome.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had a 3 day pass of Rome which meant unlimited bus fare, free admission to two museums or sites, and reduced admission for anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
              On our first day we visited the collisseum and it was pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, we went to the Borgheiss Museum which is like the top dog art museum in Rome.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we arrived, around 3 PM, the lady in the ticket booth told us we could only reserve tickets over the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we left and sat at a random desolate bus station for half an hour.
            </p>
            <p>
              There was a stable of horses right next to it, so I just passed time neighing to the horses and watching their reactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the bus never came so we just started walking back and did some other things.
            </p>
            <p>
              On day two we went back to the Borgheiss Museum super early cuz we didn't even know the phone number to reserve tickets and maybe possibly reserve the tickets there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately their tickets were all sold out by 9 AM for that day so we were like, "wtf is with this museum".
            </p>
            <p>
              We talked to a different ticket attendent and this time we actually bought tickets there for 3 PM entrance to the museum for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The phone wasn't even needed?!?!? So that meant that the first day attendent lied to our faces
            </p>
            <p>
              Ok so then came the third day.
            </p>
            <p>
              We got on the bus to the Borgheiss Museum but we didnt get off at the Borgheiss Museum.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because some dude got on the bus, stole my dads wallet with the tickets and ran off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nobody even noticed till my dad tried to check the tickets because the busses there are jampacked with people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apaarently, this is a frequent thing that happens in Rome?!?! Sigh..
            </p>
            <p>
              And to make matters worse this also cancelled all our future plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              My parents had to freeze all their credit cards and my dad also lost his driver liscense and his EU drivers liscense.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were planning to drive to Pompeii on the last day but couldn't get the rental car because of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thankfully, I brought my credit card, which is also a travel rewards card so that means no foreign transaction fees, and we used that for the last couple of days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever, i'm glad that i'm going back home soon.
