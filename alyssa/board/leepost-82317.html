          <h2 class="section-heading">Today I was thinking...</h2>
          <p>
            That the camping trip after our senior year was where my whole world really started to turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, did you know that I didn't even think I would be going to it until the very last second?
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought that I wouldn't go because of how dirty camping is, how there is always a constant fear of the forests and what lurks in the dark, and on, and on, and on. But really those were excuses to for me not wanting to go because of how lost I was.
          </p>
          <p>
            What convinced me to finally go was Peter telling me to not forget all about my high school life. It was really scary how quickly I decided to cut off all my ties to everybody that I know and care about, even you, as I felt like I became more isolated from everybody.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, I thought there was a chance that I could find myself if I went to get some clean mountain air and sleep under the starlit sky with the same people who I have shared many good memories with.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was this camping trip where I think I really saw my true self and you, no longer veiled behind a friendzone filter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought that there was no way I was going to let this chance slip by, because you have a certain energy that would change the way I saw life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea that I would be so invested in developing a website that I would never get tired of doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea that the video games I have enjoyed for so long would suddenly be boring if I didn't play with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had no idea that I wanted to be productive, learn new things, and enjoy them all at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I think of the pivotal days of my life, camping was definitely one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also one of the happiest days of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love you a lot.
          </p>
