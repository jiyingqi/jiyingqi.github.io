          <p>
            the 6 hour difference in our lives has ended after a long 3 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            although we are still technically long distance, at least we coexist on the same clock and wake up roughly around the same time although you have class LOL
          </p>
          <p>
            remember david during beach week, how tilted he was because emma was in china.
          </p>
          <p>
            it was pretty funny how he was just lying on the floor and dying but that was me during this trip
          </p>
          <p>
            except even worse cause i didn't really have much to distract myself with especially during the long car trips and i missed you more than he missed emma hehe
          </p>
          <p>
            it was pretty hard
          </p>
          <p>
            at the beginning of the trip
          </p>
          <p>
            somedays i would be really grumpy until 2 pm aka when you wake up
          </p>
          <p>
            somedays i would be really quiet until 2 pm aka when i say good morning to you
          </p>
          <p>
            somedays i would be really sad until 2 pm aka when you talk to me
          </p>
          <p>
            you cheer me up so much and i love talking to you and for the rest of the day i would be feeling fly like a g6
          </p>
          <p>
            but this kind of lifestyle isn't healthy
          </p>
          <p>
            because that means i'm super dependant on you and so i decided to fix this
          </p>
          <p>
            by building this website
          </p>
          <p>
            that wasn't the only thing i did but it sounds cute the way it flows
          </p>
          <p>
            i want you to know the real reason why i created you your own page with all these subcategories
          </p>
          <p>
            you already know that its because i love you and want to write really mooshy things and be a hopeless romantic
          </p>
          <p>
            but its also for when you're not feeling so great
          </p>
          <p>
            and you can at anytime just go to this page and read all these posts and look at all the pictures and hopefully feel better
          </p>
          <p>
            and yes i still definitely want you to tell me everything that is happening and cheer you up if needed
          </p>
          <p>
            but this exists for you always
          </p>
          <p>
            unless an artificial intelligence uprising occurs and wipes out the internet but oh well, we can deal with that if it happens
          </p>
          <h2 style="color:pink" class="section-heading">I'm so happy to be back <3</h2>
