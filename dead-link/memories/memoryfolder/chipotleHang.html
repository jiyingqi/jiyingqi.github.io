          <h2 style="color:pink" class="section-heading">Remember our first offical date?</h2>
          <p>
            we decided to go visit Varun and Aaron when they were working and you were wearing your pink shirt.
          </p>
          <p>
            i really like that shirt because you look so cute in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            anywaysss, we were both sharing a burrito bowl and there was no cheese and sour cream because i didn't want to get you too plump.
          </p>
          <p>
            in the end, it didnt even matter...
          </p>
          <p>
            because you're perfect just the way you are and not fat :)
          </p>
          <p>
            anywayssssss, we kept on looking at Varun and winking at him and i'm sure that he was very annoyed by it and would kick us out of that establishment if he wanted to
          </p>
          <p>
            but he's a good friend so he played along with us, perhaps it was out of boredom too cuz there was no traffic
          </p>
          <p>
            anywaysssssssss, afterwards we decided to hang out at the terraced park area
          </p>
          <p>
            the weather was fair, the mood was great, the conversations was awesome, but the view...
          </p>
          <p>
            the view of the little girl getting ass blasted by the fountain was something else
          </p>
          <p>
            anywayssssssssssss, we got takis and water and lactose free milk from the nearby CVS and talked for so long
          </p>
          <p>
            but i didn't even notice all that time passing by because i was having such a fun time eating the super super salty takis
          </p>
          <p>
            you wouldn't even touch the takis cuz of how powdery the sticks are so i had to take the L and feed you it
          </p>
          <p>
            then when varun and aaron were done with their shift, we invited them over so they could eat the leftover takis l m a o
          </p>
          <p>
            and they did come and we were like, "okay gotta act like friends cuz we were keeping a secret"
          </p>
          <p>
            still made them think we were hella sus
          </p>
          <p>
            but that was pretty fun just the four of us talking about drama and stuff
          </p>
          <p>
            then they left and we all walked back together and said goodbye to each other
          </p>
          <p>
            BUT MIND GAME, we just walked back to try to find a bathroom for you cuz you drank so much milk
          </p>
          <p>
            all the stores were closed so it was like omg what are we going to do but then we found the visitor center and we did our business there
          </p>
          <p>
            we walked back to the parking lot and instead of going home, we just sat on a bench together
          </p>
          <p>
            it started raining but i had an umbrella so we were safe and continued to sit there and appreciate each other
          </p>
          <p>
            no amount of weather would have split us up that day
          </p>
          <p>
            however, if a hurricane struck us on that day then we would have been tossed like salads
          </p>
          <p>
            also i pray for the southern texas residents and people who are about to be struck by that terrifying hurricane to be safe
          </p>
          <p>
            anywaysssssssssssssss, this whole memory just felt so good and i feel so elated when i think about it
          </p>
          <p>
            i loved sharing this time with you
          </p>
